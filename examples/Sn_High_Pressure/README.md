# introduction:
This file indicate the calculation example for calculating Sn Beta phase High Pressure Phase Diagram.
See: https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.053603
The files in this dir describe the relating json files for calculating Tin's Free Energy at 200K,2GPa.

The example simulation MD steps:

NPT: 1M steps. NVT:200K
TI:300K HTI 500K for each lambda value.

This example can be treated as an example template and parameters could be changed for your own research.
