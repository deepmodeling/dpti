# üèûbrief Introduction

**dpti** (deep potential thermodynamic integration) is a python package for calculating free energy, doing thermodynamic integration and figuring out pressure-temperature phase diagram for materials with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods.


<br />The user will get Gibbs (Helmholtz) free energy of a system at different temperature and pressure conditions. With these free energy results, the user could determine the phase transition points and coexistence curve on the pressure-volume phase diagram.

# ü¶¥software introduction
At first, dpti is a collection of python scripts to generate LAMMPS input scripts and to anaylze results from LAMMPS logs.<br />
<br />In dpti, there are many MD simulations tasks and scripts need to be run sequentially or concurrently. Before and after these MD simulation tasks, we may run a lot of MD scirpts to prepare the input files or analyze the logs to extract the useful data.<br />
<br />Then the dpti developers use apache-airflow to resolve the MD tasks dependencies and managing running tasks. <br />

<a name="46bdda688b5bc33d261bccfb389fdf55"></a>
# üìÉInstallation

dpti use apache-airflow as workflow framework, and dpdispatcher to interact with the HPC systems (slurm or PBS).


airflow use realation database (PostgreSQL, MySQL or Sqlite) as backend to store the metadata, DAGs definetion and nodes state etc.

# üí™extra info

The backend of this software is based on the software `airflow`. The following command can start the calculation.

<br />
<br />The first command is used for calculate the free energy of solid.<br />The second command is used for calculate the free energy of liquid.<br />

```bash
airflow trigger_dag HTI_taskflow --conf $(printf "%s" $(cat FreeEnergy.json))
airflow trigger_dag TI_taskflow --conf $(printf "%s" $(cat FreeEnergy.meam.json))
```


1. We usually want to calculate the free energy of a metal at a specific pressure or temperature.  And the crystal structure of the metal can be various. For example,  we want to calculate the free energy of metal Sn of bcc structure at 200 K and 50000 bar (5GPa). In order to caculate the per atom free energy of metal Sn. First, We must prepare a configuration file named bcc.lmp and modify the [FreeEnergy.json](#ULX0o) or [FreeEnergyLiquid.json](#WuLBQ) and modify the key-value pair  like "structure": "bcc", "target_temp": 200, "target_press" : 50000.  And decide  whether to integrate along the  t(temperature) path  or along the p(pressure) path . Modify the "path" key-value pair for this.  The key-value pair "ensemble" for lammps MD simulation. Usually the ensemble shoule be consistent with the crystal intrinsic structure. That means we should set "npt-iso" for structure "bcc" to keep the simulation box changes simultaneously in x, y, z directions.
2. modify the ti.t.json or ti.p.json, and change the key-value pair "temps" or "press" .  For ti.t.json, the tar_temp of FreeEnergy.json must be in the list  which the key-value pair "temps" of ti.t.json represents. And similarly for ti.p.json, the tar_press of FreeEnergy.json must be in the list which the key-value pair "temps" of ti.t.json represents.
3. Use the command `airflow trigger_dag`¬† mentioned above. This command will start a [airflow dag](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html).This dag is wrote and maintained by the dpti software developer. It is used to make the calculation to be done more autocally . The user could monitor the task state and calculation procedure at [a website](#2aabcbd6). The user can also rerun, restart, delete the whole calculation or some part of the calculations.
4. Wait until the calculation finish. Usually the whole procedure continues for about 6 to 10 hours. The calculations will be done autocally.
5. Find the results in [Results Show](#2aabcbd6) part. The user could use the tables and data of it and plot the curve.



<a name="ac613c1818ba355261da25b7b1a1e194"></a>
# üìåResults Show

<br />For each step, the result files are located at the corresponding location.<br />For example, we start a calculation at `/home/user1/metal_Sn/1_free_energy/400K-0bar-bcc-t`<br />
<br />For NPT MD simulation, the result file will  locate at `/home/user1/metal_Sn/1_free_energy/400K-0bar-bcc-t/NPT_sim/result`<br />
<br />For TI simulation the result will locate at `/home/fengbo/4_Sn/1_free_energy/400K-0bar-bct-t/TI_sim/result`<br />
<br />You may want to use the result file and datas of  TI_sim/result and plot the free_energy vs T curve for different structure and find the crossing point.<br />

The user can ssh contect to the aliyun cloud server by command like `¬†ssh -L localhost:8080:localhost:8080 user1@67.xxx.xxx.25`¬† and visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to monitor the free energy calculation tasks procedure.

# üíéThe procedure of the free energy calculations

<br />To calculate out Gibbs (or Helmholtz) free energy of the materials, there are four steps.<br />

1. NPT MD simulation
1. NVT MD simulation
1. Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration
4. thermodynamic integration



<a name="63776a50b2f742b9a30748457523f601_h2_0"></a>
## NPT simulation
Run a long MD simulation and we will get the lattice constant and the best simulation box for the simulations next.
<a name="39392588f286118c98731051706b06dc_h2_1"></a>
## NVT simulation
Run a long MD simulation with the end structure of NPT simulations. We will know whether the box is reasonable enough from the results of this MD simulation.
<a name="14932184266288e8651c16aebdbfbb8e_h2_2"></a>
## Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration (HTI)
We will know the Gibbs (or Helmholtz) free energy at the specific temperature or pressure condition.
<a name="56937698a8d18e2013bea45f6dfe5890_h2_3"></a>
## thermodynamic integration (TI)
Integrating along the isothermal or isobaric¬†path, We will know the free energy at different pressure and temperature.<br />

<a name="ebf132332b4d6dc4e1ac472cd3ca6183_h1_5"></a>

then first we will run a 500000 steps MD, and generate 500000/10==50000 data points.
the first stat_skip==1000 points will be ignored,
then the last 49000 points will be grouped into 49000/100==490 chunks.
The average value the of the 100 point value in each chunk will treated as chunk value.
And the 490 chunk values will also be averaged as the final result value for this MD.

# FAQ

## simulation related:

### phase transition:
For thermodynamics integration: there is a restrict that no phase transition should happen during the integration path.
This means that for the simulation process lambda changing from 0 to 1, the structure of system should not change dramatically. (like metal to liquid, lattice constants largely change).

In practice, we could monitor the RDF(compute rdf) of the structure during simulation. The rdf could be used as an indicator for the structure changes. The RMSD value of this system could also be used as indicator.

### integration path:

For thermodynamics integration, sometimes it may not be a choice to directly change from the initial state(Einstein solid, Ideal Gas) to the final target state. 

To extend the integration and avoid phase transition during MD simulation, it may be better to introduce some intermediate during simulation, this is implemented in dpti software called two-steps and three-steps.(At least, this strategy could take effects for water(ice) and metal Tin(Sn))

For researcher, it is recommended to try both the direct path protocol and the intermediate state protocol. And compare the results.
And repeat the calculation at least for one more time at a specific temperature and pressure and check the result consistence. 

If the result errors lie in about 1meV/per atom. (maybe about 10K-20K in phase diagram) We could treat it as a reliable result.

### atom number in simulation:
Usually the atom number should be about 100-200. Larger system is OK.
Size effect is not obvious.(increasing the simulation size will usually get similar free energy values).
